### Usage:
###    starphleet-devmode-install-check
### --help
###
### Run through the various particulars of starphleet in devmode and give
### feedback to the user whether they are deployed successfully

# This does nothing more than check the various aspects of dev mode and makes
# sure everything has finished installing.  Additionally provides feedback
# to the user so they know where things are in the process.  Specifically:
#
#     - Make sure starphleet is running
#     - Test the keys in /var/starphleet/private_keys against github
#     - Make sure /var/starphleet/headquarters is checked out
#     - Report status on the initial sync of starphleet
#     - Notify the user that all components are complete

Starphleet has just finished setting up dev mode.  The containers
are building for the first time.  This will take approximately
the same time as a deploy to production starphleet.
