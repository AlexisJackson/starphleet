### Usage:
###    starphleet-devmode-install-check
### --help
###
### Run through the various particulars of starphleet in devmode and give
### feedback to the user whether they are deployed successfully

# This does nothing more than check the various aspects of dev mode and makes
# sure everything has finished installation.  Additionally provides feedback
# to the user so they know where things are in the process.  Specifically:
#
#     - Make sure starphleet is running
#     - Test the keys in /var/starphleet/private_keys against github
#     - Make sure /var/starphleet/headquarters is checked out
#     - Report status on the initial sync of starphleet
#     - Notify the user that all components are complete
